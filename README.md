### Cracking Enigma with Clojure

My first attempt at functional programming with Clojure. Code to emulate and crack the [Enigma Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) used during the Second World War. Includes a variable number of 10 rotors in series, set in any staring rotation, one of four reflectors, and a plug-board.
